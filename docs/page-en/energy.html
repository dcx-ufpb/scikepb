            <h1>Importance of Energy Management</h1>
            <p>Energy is to be regarded as a necessary business cost, directly associated to production and every other process in all companies, just like labour. Companies can achieve substantial reduction in energy bills by implementing simple housekeeping measures that are quite simple to achieve. Reduction and control of energy usage is vital for an organization as it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduces costs: Reducing cost may be considered as the most compelling reason for saving energy, because it causes a direct positive accounting factor. Most organisations can save up to 20% on their energy cost by simply managing its use.</li>
                <li>Reduces carbon emissions: Most people in the world woul consider the reduction of poluition as the main outcome of energy consumition reduction. Due to climate changes and consequent reduction of the level of water reservoirs, oil powered generators are used all over the world. Diesel engines move a large portion of the world's goods, power much of the world's equipment, and generate electricity more economically than any other device in their size range. But the diesel is one of the largest contributors to environmental pollution problems worldwide, causing ever-increasing global emissions. Diesel emissions contribute to the development of several important diseases, like cancer; cardiovascular and respiratory health effects; It also causes the pollution of air, water, and soil; soiling; reductions in visibility; and global climate change. Reducing energy consumption also reduces carbon emissions and adverse environmental effects. Reducing your organisation’s carbon footprint helps build a ‘green’ image thereby generating good business opportunities.</li>
                <li>Reduce risk: Reducing energy use helps reduce risk of energy price fluctuations and supply shortages that may be caused by na always growing energy demand.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Companies worldwide are showing a growing interest in promoting energy management on its activities. This might be achieved through a series of steps starting with setting up a system to collect, analyse and report on energy consumption and costs which may involve reading electricity meters regularly and analysis of utility bills.</p>
            <p>In addition to obtaining financial benefits, sound energy management is rapidly emerging as an integral part of carbon management which in turn helps organisations in effective overall environmental management, bringing other significant advantages for an organisation such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organisations achieve stronger market position by demonstrating ‘green’ credentials under na efficient energy management policy; it improves competitive advantage as most consumers prefer to source from socially responsible businesses;</li>
                <li>Energy management systems can influence supply chains by preferring suppliers who adopt environment management practices; and</li>
                <li>Energy management creates a better workplace environment for employees by improving working conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Energy management system (EMS)</h1>
            <p>An energy management system (EMS) is a system used for surveillance of energy consumption. It helps in optimizing the utility of energy.</p>
            <p>EMS reads numerous energy meters. It is embedded in a building or a campus, and simultaneously monitors different divisions to save bulk energy consumption. Energy monitoring system can detect overloading from a section and enable control measures to act against it. An energy monitoring system make the citizens more environment conscious.</p>
            <p>This system takes an analysis of the overall utility pattern and implements measures to reduce the energy usage. It can check the frequency of consumption and update its data regularly. With a change in the consumer behavior, it alters its control level from time to time.</p>
            <p>It also helps to anticipate future energy needs and improve one’s energy performance in the long run. EMS encourages the consumer to use the energy sensibly. It helps to save the environment from adverse effects.</p>

            <h1>Importance of EMS in the contemporary world</h1>
            <p>EMS plays a key role in reducing the problems caused by the use of fossile fuel to the environment. Although eliminating these gases is barely possible, the use of EMS turns it possible to bring situations under control.</p>
            <p>EMS can also generate energy through saved energy. This method is secured for the user and prevents any misuse of it by others. The system is a reliable source to protect energy. At times, when energy supply is less than the required amount then this stored energy can be efficiently used. EMS ensures right usage of energy, minimizing the wastage. With the reduction in energy consumption, it also helps in reducing the costs.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the fuel prices have skyrocketed in many countries, mainly in Brazil; In such a daunting situation, if energy consumption is somehow reduced, it helps the consumer to reduce inflated bills leading to better savings.</p>
            <p>A large amount of energy is lost when circulated. There is a large gap between energy, given by the electric power distribuition company and that which the users consume. Such transmission losses can be widely decreased through the use of EMS, which is effective in giving energy solutions.</p>
            <p>When a company uses EMS, it becomes an integral part to form its agenda. Policies are altered to include energy saving methods in its ambit, promoting a solid cultural paradigm. It encourages the employees to act on various aspects of energy problems. The company then targets energy saving and adopts eminent measures to reduce energy consumption.</p>

            <h1>Consumers use non-renewable energy resources to a greater extent.</h1>
            <p>These resources are becoming depleted as time goes by. At the current rate of consumption, the future generations are more likely not to avail them. Finding solutions to guarantee energy provision to the future generations has become extremely vital. This has made energy consulting services important. People have now started understanding all of these concerns which has given a boost to Energy Management Systems everywhere.</p>
